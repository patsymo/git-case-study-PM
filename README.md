# Case Study: Git with Templates and Markdown Styling

This exercise helps you understand Git commands and how to work with branches, commit changes, and resolve merge conflicts.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing. See deployment for details on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following:

- Git installed on your system
- Access to a GitHub repository
- A text editor (such as VS Code or Sublime Text)

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the development environment:

```sh
$ Clone the repository
$ Navigate to the project directory
$ Install any necessary dependencies
```

## Usage

Here are some examples of commands you might use:

```sh
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Your commit message"
$ git push origin branch-name
```

### Branches

- **Main:** Protected branch where all final changes are merged.
- **Develop:** Branch used for active development before merging to Main.


### Workflow Steps

1. Create a new repository.
2. Add instructional staff as collaborators.
3. Protect the `main` branch.
4. Create a `develop` branch.
5. Use Markdown templates for:
   - Commit messages
   - Pull requests
   - Issues
6. Complete the `README.md` file based on case study details.
7. Notify instructional staff for pull request feedback and approval.
8. Create an issue for Eric’s feature.
9. Add Eric’s files (`welcome.js`, `getName.js`).
10. Submit a pull request with Eric’s changes.
11. Link the issue to the pull request.
12. Merge changes to the `develop` branch.
13. Merge `develop` into `main`.

Make sure to follow the commit history for each change. If you encounter merge conflicts, reach out for assistance.
